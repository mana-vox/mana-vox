**MANA-Vox** employs a comprehensive methodology for identifying and selecting credible sources to unveil the environmental damage caused by companies. This methodology relies on a network of information sources and a sophisticated algorithm. Initially designed to assess the impact of companies on forests, the methodology is now adaptable to address various environmental issues, including freshwater, oceans, biodiversity, and climate change.

## Credible Sources

Within the **MANA** community, a credible source is defined as an organization or individual capable of providing trustworthy information regarding a company's environmental impacts. The credibility of these sources is established based on the trust of at least one of the three closest NGOs to the **MANA** communityâ€”**WWF, Greenpeace, and Friends of the Earth**.

## Our Network of Whistle-blowers

The selection of credible sources, or "credibilization," is built upon the reputation of **WWF, Greenpeace, and Friends of the Earth** as reliable sources of information, collectively known as the "Friendly NGOs" within the **MANA** community. Individuals or non-profit organizations associated with any of these three NGOs are also deemed credible sources. The sources linked to the Friendly NGOs constitute the "NGOs network" and may identify other credible individuals or non-profit organizations, referred to as "Whistle-blowers" in our terminology. All these sources contribute information that can be presented on **MANA-Vox**.

The selection of information sources can be carried out either manually or through an algorithm.

### Manual Selection of Credible Sources

- **Level 1** comprises the Friendly NGOs (WWF, Greenpeace, and Friends of the Earth).
- **Level 2** consists of sources recommended by Level 1 entities.
- **Level 3** includes sources recommended by Level 2 sources.

Level 3 entities or individuals cannot further recommend additional sources, ensuring that any source remains no more than two levels away from a Friendly NGO. Level 3 sources may still be considered credible if they have a partnership with Level 1 or Level 2 sources and have received public funding. Additionally, foundations, both private and public, that fund a Level 1 NGO can be considered credible if endorsed by the MANA Community professional responsible for assessing source credibility.

### Algorithmic Selection of Credible Sources

The **MANA-Vox** algorithm extracts data from the Twitter accounts of Friendly NGOs to identify individuals or organizations cited as information sources. When a Friendly NGO references a source, it is presumed to endorse the information provided by that source.

To be considered a potential candidate source, a source must be cited at least three times by a Friendly NGO. Each potential source undergoes manual review to determine its country of origin and whether that country is located in a region deemed a high priority for combatting forest destruction.

A source is considered credible if it has been the origin of news at least ten times and has been cited by at least two Friendly NGOs. Once a source is geolocated, it awaits endorsement by two reference NGOs before being acknowledged as credible.
